The 4 files:
  keysym.h.ml, keysymdef.h.ml,
  keysym_match.h.ml, keysymdef_match.h.ml
have been made from my headers:
  /usr/include/X11/keysym.h
  /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
which I have rewritten to make these OCaml compliant.

My original .h files are provided in case you may be 
willing to compare these with yours.
